This repository is the space for the projects i will do during my apprenticeship.

## Test1
I made some examples in C++ and tried some new things.

## GuiEsempio
I have been asked to make a GUI example in JavaSwing. 

## HTTPC
In this folder there is a Java Project that permits the user to ask data from a website using a url. I imported Java Swing, even if it's not used anymore. In my host company i had to make the project able to turn on/off the relays using a LAN, and i made it, letting the user write a number [1-6], rel√® for the relay position, and another [0-1] to turn on/off.
